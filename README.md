Key components of the code.
1. Imports:
    We import necessary modules and components from external libraries. In this case, we're using React, axios for making HTTP requests, react-loader-spinner for displaying a loading spinner, and Font Awesome icons 
    for displaying a frown icon in case of an error.

2. Functional Component: WeatherApp:
   This is a functional component named WeatherApp, which is the main component of our application.

3. State Management with useState:
   We use the useState hook to manage state within our component. Three state variables are initialized:
     > `input`: to store the value of the city input field.
     > `weather`: an object containing loading, data, and error properties to manage the weather data fetching process.

4. toDateFunction:
   This function generates the current date in a specific format using JavaScript's Date object.

5. search Function:
   > This function is triggered when the user presses the Enter key while typing in the city search input field.
   > It sets the loading state to true, resets the input field, and then makes an asynchronous GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using axios.
   > Upon receiving a response, it updates the weather state with the retrieved data and sets loading to false.
   > If an error occurs during the request, it sets the error state to true.

6. Rendering JSX:
   > The return statement contains JSX code to render the UI.
   > It includes an input field for users to enter the city name, which triggers the search function.
   > It conditionally renders loading spinner, error message, and weather data based on the state.
   > If weather data is available, it displays the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, weather description, and wind speed.

7. Export Default:
   > The WeatherApp component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
